The code uses the mediapipe library by google to detect the hands and controll the mouse pointer using the hand gestures.
The model has the capability to move the mouse pointer, left click, right click.
The mouse pointer starts moving when the thumb and the hand has zero distance between them and stops moving when the distance is greated than zero.
The mouse clicks when the index finger is closed from the open position and similarly for the right click use the middle finger.
Close the distance between thumb and the hand to click accurately or the mouse pointer will not click accurately.
